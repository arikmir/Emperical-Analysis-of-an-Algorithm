 **Project Summary**
 
This focus of this project is to identify basic operations and execution time while empirically analyzing the average case efficiency and the time complexity of the Brute Force Median Algorithm. The aforementioned algorithm was implemented in C# on a Windows environment. The number of basic operations and the execution time of this algorithm, in the case of average efficiency, was measured by comparing against arrays of varying lengths. And the functionality of the algorithm was also proved by using various testing cases. The experimental results were analyzed and graphed using Microsoft Excel. The average case efficiency for both basic operations and the execution time of this algorithm was found to be in order with the expected theoretical predictions.
